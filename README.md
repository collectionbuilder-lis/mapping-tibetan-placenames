# Mapping Tibetan Placenames

## About the Collection

"Mapping Tibetan Placenames" is a digital initiative aimed at documenting and standardizing the diverse names used for places across the Tibetan Plateau. In the multilingual context of Tibetan, English, and Chinese, placenames often vary significantly in spelling, pronunciation, and usage. This project seeks to bring consistency to these geographic names, providing a comprehensive resource for researchers, linguists, and anyone interested in the geographic and cultural landscape of Tibet.

Through the compilation of Tibetan, English, and Chinese placenames, this platform highlights the complexities of transliteration and differences in naming conventions. By offering an accessible reference, the project aims to promote a deeper understanding of place names while fostering accurate communication across languages and cultures.
