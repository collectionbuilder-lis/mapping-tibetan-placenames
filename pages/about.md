## About the Collection

"Mapping Tibetan Placenames" is a digital initiative aimed at documenting and standardizing the diverse names used for places across the Tibetan Plateau. In the multilingual context of Tibetan, English, and Chinese, placenames often vary significantly in spelling, pronunciation, and usage. This project seeks to bring consistency to these geographic names, providing a comprehensive resource for researchers, linguists, and anyone interested in the geographic and cultural landscape of Tibet.

Through the compilation of Tibetan, English, and Chinese placenames, this platform highlights the complexities of transliteration and differences in naming conventions. By offering an accessible reference, the project aims to promote a deeper understanding of place names while fostering accurate communication across languages and cultures.

<!-- ## About the Site

This demo collection features items from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/), and is build using [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv).

CollectionBuilder-CSV is a "Stand Alone" template for creating digital collection and exhibit websites using Jekyll, given:

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of images, PDFs, audio, or video files

Driven by your collection metadata, the template generates engaging visualizations to browse and explore your objects.
The resulting static site can be hosted on any basic web server.

[CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/) is an set of open source tools for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology.
See [CB Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for detailed information. -->
